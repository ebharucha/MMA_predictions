Using basic supervised learning to predict fight outcomes

The current dataset is restricted to the UFC

Have not fine tuned any of the models.
The Deep Learning models are WIP & not operational

The overall proecss of acquiring data and running the models needs to be automated.  

To run ...

## Step 1
Create "fight_card.xlsx" in the data directory with the following structure
weight_class      fighter1    fighter2
or populate the 'df_fight_card' DataFrame
This contains the bouts for which outcomes would get predicted

## Step 2
Execite the 'Load Dependencies' section

## Step 3
Execute the 'Load Datasets' section

## Step 4
Execute the 'Predict' section
